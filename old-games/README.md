Old Games

I spent quite a bit of time experimenting with game technology when I was first learning how to program. I played with tons of ideas, many of which turned out to be no good, but I learned a ton about graphics and development in the process.

An extremely fast minecraft clone. Written in C and OpenGL.

I wrote my own lightmapper and UV unwrapper in Objective-C.

A small demo for a sci-fi adventure game engine. Written in C and OpenGL.

![ocean screenshot](ocean.jpg)

An adventure game in which players explore the ocean. One feature I like allows the player to take a picture and store it in an album. The game recognizes which fish are in the picture so it can reward them for collecting them all.

![platform screenshot](platform.jpg)

An action platform game where players avoid obstacles by jumping and running up walls.

A puzzle game I created for a school competition. Written in C++ and OpenGL.

A platform shooter game.
