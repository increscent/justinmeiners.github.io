Welcome to my personal site about programming, mathematics, and philosophy!

Throughout my career I have worked in many different areas of software including mobile, web, computer graphics, and cryptocurrency.
I am currently a graduate student in mathematics at [BYU](https://math.byu.edu) and
work as a consultant for various software projects.

If you are interested in my professional experience, see my [CV](files/cv.pdf).
